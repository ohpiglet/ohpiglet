We went for a big hike with Auntie Anne.

At the first little lake we stopped for a little break.

First glimpse of the 'orange box' refugi in the evening sunlight.

Once we got settled in there was just time for a group photo before it started to get very col.

Sunset came quickly.

We stayed up very late, lying outside in our sleeping bags looking at the bright, bright stars. In the morning we took a selfie with the Refugi Gerber Mataró.

We began the climb back down long before the sun hit the bowl in the mountains.

The path ahead with the sun starting to arrive.

Riu hiking out, with the ribbon lakes in the distance.

Looking back with Auntie Anne bringing up the rear of the group.

Gnarly tree root.

Straight ahead or over that way?

We passed this lovely lake. On the way down it marked the first place we intersected with the sunlight.

We love this hike. We should do it every year.
