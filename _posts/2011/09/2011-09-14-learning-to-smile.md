Thanks Granizado Oglesby for the lovely flowers! Not only did she send flowers after she left, Granizado Oglesby did a makeover on the terrace while she was here, bringing Birds of Paradise, Andalucian flower pots and passion fruit creepers to our world.![yo yo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2011/tumblr_lrir6vNyxl1qlj3bd.jpg)

Not only is _riu_ Catala for _river_, our spiritual home, it also means _she smiles_.

Hooray for flowers, and hooray for baby smiles!
