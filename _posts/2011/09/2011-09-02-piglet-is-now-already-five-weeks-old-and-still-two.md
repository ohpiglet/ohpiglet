Piglet is now already five weeks old and still two weeks away from going to Ireland to visit her paternal granny. Granizado Kennedy hasn’t seen her first grandchild in action yet, so we made this little video last night while listening to Mogwai’s ‘Young Team.'

She sucks on her soother, stares off into the distance, drools a little, flails and chills in equal measure, and generally looks cute. Excuse the sudden jumps between 'scenes’ - that’s because we had to edit out lots of wailing. I’m hoping she was just hungry, rather than not liking the music.
