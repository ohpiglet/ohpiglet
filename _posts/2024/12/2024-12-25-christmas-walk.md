We went for two Christmas Day walks!

First we went up to the flags.

Tagua came too.

Saoirse posed for some photos, with some guidance from Riu I suspect.

And then skipped off down the hill.

A lovely warm day on the mountain.

After Christmas lunch we went up to Refugi Gall Fer, where it wasn't so warm.
